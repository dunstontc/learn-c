## 2.1. Variable Names

Although we didn't say so in Chapter 1, there are some restrictions on the names of variables and symbolic constants. Names are made up of letters and digits; the first character must be a letter. The underscore `"_"` counts as a letter; it is sometimes useful for improving the readability of long variable names. Don't begin variable names with underscore, however,since library routines often use such names. Upper case and lower case letters are distinct, so `x` and `X` are two different names. Traditional C practice is to use lower case for variable names, and all upper case for symbolic constants.

At least the first 31 characters of an internal name are significant. For function names and external variables, the number may be less than 31, because external names may be used by assemblers and loaders over which the language has no control. For external names, the standard guarantees uniqueness only for 6 characters and a single case. Keywords like `if`, `else`, `int`, `float`, etc., are reserved; you can't use them as variable names. They must be in lower case.

It's wise to choose variable names that are related to the purpose of the variable, and that are unlikely to get mixed up typographically. We tend to use short' names for local variables, especially loop indices, and longer names for external variables.
