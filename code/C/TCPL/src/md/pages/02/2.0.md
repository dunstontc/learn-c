# Chapter 2: Types, Operators, and Expressions

Variables and constants are the basic data objects manipulated in a program. Declarations list the variables to be used, and state what type they have and perhaps what their initial values are. Operators specify what is to be done to them. Expressions combine variables and constants to produce new values. The type of an object determines the set of values it can have and what operations can be performed on it. These building blocks are the topics of this chapter.  

The ANSI standard has made many small changes and additions to basic types and expressions. There are now `signed` and `unsigned` forms of all integer types, and notations for unsigned constants and hexadecimal character constants. Floating-point operations may be done in single precision;.there is also a `long double` type for extended precision. String constants may be concatenated at compile time. Enumerations have become part of the language, formalizing a feature of long standing. Objects may be declared `const`, which prevents them from being changed. The rules for automatic coercions among arithmetic types have been augmented to handle the richer set of types.
