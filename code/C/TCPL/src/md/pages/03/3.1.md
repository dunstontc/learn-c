## 3.1. Statements and Blocks

An expressionsuch as `x = 0` or `i++` or `printf(...)` becomes a statement when it is followed by a semicolon, as in
```c
    x = 0;
    i++;
    printf("...");
```
In C, the semicolon is a statement terminator, rather than a separator as it is in languages like Pascal.

Braces `{` and `}` are used to group declarations and statements together into a *compound statement*, or *block*, so that they are syntactically equivalent to a single statement. The braces that surround the statements of a function are one obvious example; braces around multiple statements after an `if`, `else`, `while`, or `for` are another. (Variables can be declared inside any block; we will talk about this in Chapter 4.) There is no semicolon after the right brace that ends a block.
