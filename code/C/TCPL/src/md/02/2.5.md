## 2.5. Arithmetic Operators

The binary arithmetic operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and the modulus operator `%`. Integer division truncates any fractional part. The expression
```c
    x % y
```
produces the remainder when `x` is divided by `y`, and thus is zero when `y` divides `x` exactly. For example, a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, except that years divisible by 400 *are* leap years. Therefore
```c
    if ((year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || year % 400 == 0) 
        printf("%d is a leap year\n", year);
    else 
        printf("%d is not a leap year\n", year);
```

The `%` operator cannot be applied to `float` or `double`. The direction of truncation for `/` and the sign of the result for `%` are machine-dependent for negative operands, as is the action taken on overflow or underflow.

The binary `+` and `-` operators have the same precedence, which is lower than the precedence of `*`, `/`, and `%`, which is in turn lower than unary `+` and `-`. Arithmetic operators associate left to right.

Table 2-1 at the end of this chapter summarizes precedence and associativity for all operators.
